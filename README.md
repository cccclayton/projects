# Welcome to my Github!
These are my projects that I've done over the years as a Data Science student. As for the projects I've done in my first year, I lost them to time T_T

16/5/2024 - I've discovered that some files (jupyter notebooks) get corrupted when uploading them to github. So if you see some empty folders, it means I'm still trying to rectify that issue.
